# ZoologyFlashcards
A small project to help a biology student learn some species with flashcards. It contains the data and (blurred) photos for the species, as well as python code that generates the PDF with the flashcards.

They are 50 flashcards, one for each organism requiered to identify in zoology class. Most data like scientific and vulgar names is saved in CartonsZoo.csv.

Due to licensing issues (or rather my intention to avoid licensing issues) all photos are blurred. I'm sorry :(.

Vulgar names are in Galician Portuguese, the ones with an asterisk (\*) are rough translations from English, Spanish or Latin.
