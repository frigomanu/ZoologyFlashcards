# ZoologyFlashcards
A small project to help a biology student learn some species with flashcards. It contains the data and (blurred) photos for the species, as well as python code that generates the PDF with the flashcards.
Due to licensing issues (or rather my intention to avoid licensing issues) all photos are blurred. I'm sorry :(.
